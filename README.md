# UFOs
Challenge 11


### This is a really good challenge as it is possible to fully use all the web tools, javascript, css and html.
### Lets start by looking at the data.js file. We are able to note that it had data stored into it. All the data is stored in the JavaScript format so that it can be read. It has what we call multidimensional arrays, an array of elements. Each element is also another array.

### We then have our HTML that is the structure of the Web pages. We have coded it so that it communicates with our JavaScript file. It has a code where the user is able to input data which will then be filtered. 

### The website will look like the following at the beginning.
